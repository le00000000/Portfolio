                Designing Energy-Efficient Smart Lighting Systems Using IoT Technologies
            </h3>
            <p>
                In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, creating a home
                environment that is both energy-efficient and convenient is more 
                attainable than ever. One innovative approach to achieving this 
                balance is through the implementation of a Smart Lighting System.
                This system adjusts lighting based on occupancy and ambient light
                conditions, ensuring optimal illumination while minimizing energy
                consumption.   
            </p>

            <h4>
                Key Components of a Smart Lighting System
            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Occupancy Sensors: These devices detect the presence of individuals in a room, enabling the system to turn lights on when the space is occupied and off when it's vacant. Implementing occupancy sensors can lead to energy savings ranging from 10% to 90%, depending on room usage patterns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ambient Light Sensors: Also known as photocells, these sensors measure the level of natural light in a space. The system uses this data to dim or brighten artificial lighting, maintaining consistent illumination levels and reducing unnecessary energy use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Automated Controls: These include programmable timers and dimmers that adjust lighting based on predefined schedules or real-time sensor inputs. For instance, lights can be programmed to dim during daylight hours when sufficient natural light is available.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h4>
